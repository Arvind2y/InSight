            My name is Hal Mulberts and I grew up on a farm in Kansas with my family of five. Life was simple. The vast
            fields bore witness to our curiosity, and as kids, we often took to the expansive backyard for our
            adventures. As we got older we worked the land we lived on. It demanded tilling, planting, caring,
            fertilizing, and harvesting. To repeat the process, it demanded rest. I learned there is no other way to
            successfully farm than by obeying the rules of the land. Infractions of these rules meant poor harvest or
            poor crops, and we knew having either meant scrimping in the next season.

            My siblings and I participated in the farming. Though for many days a week we would leave the farm to
            attend school. Soon we found a rhythm between both our duties.

            I quckly understood the importance of preparation, hard work, and respect. I applied these values to my
            endeavours by making an inventory of resources, planning my activities for efficiency, working on my goals
            every single day, and giving my body the necessary rest it needed to operate. My upbringing has completely
            supported my development and I am thankful for it.
